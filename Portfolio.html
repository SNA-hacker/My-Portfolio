            <p>I am a passionate web developer with strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
                I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that provide great experiences.
                My focus is on writing well-structured code and applying best practices in front-end development.
                I love turning creative ideas into fully functional and visually appealing web pages.
                With Bootstrap, I can quickly design layouts that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.
                JavaScript allows me to bring websites to life with interactivity and dynamic features.
                I constantly explore new trends in web development to keep my skills up to date.
                Problem-solving and debugging are challenges I enjoy while coding.
                Collaboration and continuous learning are core parts of my professional journey.
                My ultimate goal is to grow as a developer while building impactful digital solutions.</p>

                <h2>E-Commerce Product Page</h2>
                <img src="E-Commerce.png" style="width:500px">
                <p>I created a responsive E-Commerce Product Page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                    The page is designed to showcase products in a clean and attractive layout, making it easy
                    for users to browse and explore. It includes a product image section, detailed product descriptions,
                    price information, and an “Add to Cart” button for interactivity. With Bootstrap, I implemented a
                    responsive
                    grid system to ensure the layout adjusts smoothly across different devices. I also added hover
                    effects and styling
                    with CSS to make the page visually appealing. This project helped me strengthen my skills in
                    front-end design,
                    responsive layouts, and user-friendly interfaces, which are essential for real-world e-commerce
                    applications.</p>

It includes sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The portfolio is fully responsive and designed with clean UI, 
helping visitors easily navigate through my work and background. This project enhanced my ability to build structured layouts and apply responsive design techniques.</p>
